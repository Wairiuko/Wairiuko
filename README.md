#
 ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and at the same time developing a realtime collaborative art creating/sharing site using Ethereum and Ipfs for the 'back-end' and
 React Js for the front-end.
 #
 ğŸ’¬  Most of the front-end is done, as I am an artist and therefore naturally front-end-inclined ğŸ˜„ ğŸ˜„ ğŸ˜„
 #
ğŸ¤” I am looking for help with a distributed database/solution for the said dApp (Right now I am working on Orbit-db)
#
 ğŸ“« DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/simon_wairiuko) if interested.
